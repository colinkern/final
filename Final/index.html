		<h2> <p>As is, less than a quarter of New York City's subway stations are handicap accessible, despite a 1990 law that mandates all public transportation to be accessible to all. The MTA's <a href="http://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-announces-70-nyc-transit-stations-receive-55-billion-accessibility">2020-2024 Capital Plan</a> will attempt to add handicap accessible elevators to 48 stations, but the city still has hundreds more to install.  </p>

 					<p> Previously, the MTA said elevator instillation was impossible in several locations.  </p>


 <p> TransitCenter's Colin Wright, who manages the advocacy group "Access Denied" campaign, said, "Technical and engineering challenges with these projects are proven to be challenges of will and funding. We see this over and over again"</p>

 <p> The MTA's aim is to have an elevator within two stops on every line. However, that would still leave two thirds of subway stations delinquent. To completely comply with the American's with Disabilities Act, the MTA would have to install 334 elevators in addition to the incoming 48. </p>

 <p></P>

<div><h2><p>Typically, subway installations in New York also tend to go over price and schedule. The price to install an elevator at the 68th Street Hunter College Station reportedly increased from $67.2 million to $116 million. The project was part of the MTA 2010-2014 Capital Program and the station still does not have a working elevator.
